# Unicorn Meet

Technical informations are at the end of this README.<br>
You can see my project here : https://chaefloan.github.io/ :grinning:

## The context

Welcome in this Unicorn universe, a small place where some Unicorns live together !<br>
This universe is small for now but... it's growing !

Before we start, let's call our Unicorns by a nicer and cuter name: Unis.

So, here you can meet our first Unis : Lucinda, Carl, Miaou, Ka, and Philou.

### Profile :rainbow:

Each Uni has :<br>
=> a name<br>
=> an age<br>
=> a gender : Female, Male or Other<br>
=> a color<br>

Their relationship status is "Single" by default.<br>
They just arrived from another world and want to settle in this new land, and as you haven't been there yet, nothing has happened for the moment.<br>
Yes, these unicorns are waiting for you!

### Dating :cupid:

In this new universe, you can choose to match some Unis together, no matter their gender or age !

By the way, Unicorns' age is something very special.<br>
Actually, their age isn't like human age.<br>
Unicorns never get old, they live until their mystic disappearance...<br>
Age is rather a sort of indicator of maturity.<br>
For exemple, Carl is 42 (/150, the maximum). It means that he has the mentality of a 42 unicorn "year old".<br>

### Babies :baby_bottle:

Just as Unis can fall in love, they can also make babies!

There's only one condition to make a baby : it must have a parent "Female", and a parent "Male".

This is an anomaly due to the planet's climate.<br>
Babies created by non-hetero parents do not survive... for now!<br>
Yes, I'm developing a solution to allow all our unicorns to have children (adoption ? :smirk:).<br>

The specificities of the baby is that it inherits its parent's names and colors !<br>
That's usefull to recognize a family.

### Make your own Uni :heavy_check_mark:

You must noticed that there are not many unicorns for now.<br>
Why not create your own ?!

You can choose your Uni name, age, gender and color !

Want more fun ?<br>
This universe has a little bit of magic because the unicorns and children you create will be installed in your local universe, and will remain accessible even if you reload the page or close the tab!

Let's develop the colony !!

## What's next ? :arrow_down:

Here are some features I want to add :

=> change the tool for color selection (when creating a Unicorn) and display a color palette instead

=> create a "family card" when two Unis have a child, so they can be displayed together

=> give the possibility to non-hetero couples to have children

=> give a couple the opportunity to have several children, each of them will have a different color, but it will always be a mixture of their parents colors

=> add animations on the website and more precisely on the Unicorns. I want you to see they're really alive, and kind

=> Unis are likely to grow quickly, so it will be necessary to remove some of them if the population becomes too large

=> these unicorns like light, colors, what shines and illuminates, but... there are others who prefer darkness, just like some humans.<br>
I plan to develop a "dark" universe in which other types of unicorns will evolve

## Technical environment :information_source:

This universe was made with :

-> Windows 10<br>
-> Visual Studio Code<br>
-> HTML/SCSS<br>
-> Angular 13.2.3<br>
-> Node 14.17.1<br>

I designed the site myself.<br>
I also used Github and Docker/Dockerhub to save and publish it.

Oh, this application is Responsive !


Hope you'll appreciate my work !<br>
(Thanks Antoine for this project)
